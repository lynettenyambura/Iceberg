During the pendency of the main suit, several applications were filed culminating in a number of rulings giving rise to various interlocutory orders.</p><p>The trial court held that parental responsibility of NSS remained extended as per the orders of March 19, 2018 and further to the orders, the same orders would &nbsp;end upon her attaining the age of 23 years unless the respondent extended them; parental responsibility against the respondent with regards to MSS was to stop upon delivery of the judgment; the respondent was to make a monthly contribution of KES 40,000 for the upkeep of ISS and NSS, deductible directly from the respondent’s pension account; and that the amount of KES 120, 000 being received by the appellant from the respondent’s pension account was to be stopped.

Under section 2 of the Children Act, a child was referred to as any human being under the age of 18 years. Parents were under obligation to provide for their children and ensure that their rights under article 53 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 (Constitution) and the Children Act were provided for.</li><li>Article 53(1)(e) of the Constitution provided that, a child had the right to parental care and protection, which included equal responsibility of the mother and father to provide for the child, whether they were married to each other or not. As a general principle but in theory, when a child attained the age of 18 years, he or she was deemed to be independent and capable of doing his or her things and therefore no longer entitled to be provided for by the parents. Nevertheless, that was not the true position in real life as that was the age when such a child needed educational support.</li><li>There were exceptions to the general rule to the extent that, parental responsibility in respect of a child who had attained the age of majority could be extended if the court was satisfied that special circumstances existed with regard to the welfare of the child. The special circumstances were provided under section 28(1) of the Children Act. Section 91(b) of the Children Act provided for exceptional circumstances when a person who was not a child could apply to the court for a maintenance order.</li><li>The court should not make orders in vain. Any and all interlocutory orders lapsed upon delivery of judgment after the full and final determination of a suit. The first order for the extension of parental responsibilities was an interlocutory order which was subject to change upon making orders in the final judgment. The trial court did not sit like an appellate court overturning its own decision when reviewing the orders in its final judgment. Interlocutory orders were by their very nature not final orders unless adopted as such by consent or arrived at by the court in its judgment.</li><li>Since the court had already extended parental responsibility for MSS for purposes of finishing her studies, the trial court acted improperly and indeed in error by stopping further parental responsibility in terms of stopping payment of school fees by the respondent while fully aware that the respondent had partly contributed to non-completion of her studies in good time by withdrawing payment of school fees on account of the child’s indiscipline.</li><li>In the circumstances, it was not in the best interests of the child to terminate her studies at the final stage. To that extent, the trial court wrongly exercised its discretion by stopping parental responsibility at the critical stage of a child’s career and future based on poor performance and indiscipline of the child. The benefits of completing her education far outweighed any other factor bearing in mind the money and time already spent <i>vis a vis</i> the outstanding amount and time remaining to complete her education. The good news however was, MSS had finished her studies and if there were any outstanding fees (arrears) or expenses, then, the respondent was under obligation to clear the same.</li><li>If MSS had indeed finished college which was the main reason for the extension of parental responsibility in her favour, there would be nothing binding the respondent from further taking full parental responsibility against her unless a fresh application was made with sufficient reasons or grounds.</li><li>The discretion to impose conditions attendant to the extension of parental responsibility purely lay with the trial court. In the instant case, the court considered the duration a degree course was likely to take to complete. To that extent, there was no irregularity or abuse of discretion in fixing time as a condition for extension of parental responsibility.</li><li>Further extension of parental responsibilities should NSS for whatever reason including sickness fail to complete her education in time would only be done by the respondent. Under section 28(2) of the Children Act, any application for extension of parental responsibility could be made by the parent or relative of a child, any person who had parental responsibility for the child, the Director or the child.</li><li>Under section 28(2) of the Children Act, the choice as to who was supposed to apply for an extension of parental responsibility was wide. By limiting those powers to the respondent alone, the trial court applied wrong principles in law by blocking any other person entitled in law not to apply for an extension of parental responsibility. Nevertheless, imposing time frames was meant to instill discipline and hard work in children while in school.</li><li>It was not proper to give an open cheque for children to stay in school as long as they wanted yet after the age of 18 years, what a parent did for a child was a privilege that even the court could on its own motion grant or withdraw for good reason.</li><li>The respondent was retired and of advanced age. The respondent received a monthly pension of KES. 120,000 from the Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) and Kengen and had two other wives plus other children. All the companies to which the appellant used to be a director and/or partner were no longer operational hence there was no income that was derived from the companies. It was clear from the proceedings that there was a maintenance order made against the respondent to be paying a sum of KES. 120,000 out of his pension. That amount was based on the promise made under <i>talak</i> document in divorce proceedings that the respondent was to maintain the children.</li><li>Upon the children attaining the age of majority and subsequent extension of parental responsibility, and upon them proceeding abroad for further studies, the cost of their maintenance shifted from home to their place of stay that was in college. It, therefore, meant that the cost of maintaining them was no longer required or applicable at home but in college which the respondent was incurring through payment of school fees and the attendant maintenance expenses.</li><li>Pursuant to section 99 of the Children Act, a court had powers to impose conditions and to vary orders as it found appropriate. There was no parental responsibility agreement between the appellant and the respondent, and the <i>talak</i> document being relied on by the appellant was based on the respondent’s capability to provide for his children, which capability had substantially reduced unlike at the time he was giving the appellant <i>talak</i>. That was because he was retired and did not engage in any kind of gainful employment because of his advanced age.</li><li>The respondent was under a duty to maintain children. In the absence of children, the appellant would not be entitled to anything. Therefore, the demand for a full amount of maintenance as it used to be when she was staying with the children full time was not tenable. Besides, the <i>talak</i> document had no specific monthly maintenance expenses.</li><li>The <i>talak</i> document was dependent on the unmeasured and unspecified financial ability of the respondent. That did not stop the respondent from making his contribution to her children. The respondent was a human being with limited financial resources. He could not stretch beyond the limit. If he had been straining when paying school fees for three children and meeting other obligations, he could not continue doing so even when two of the children were out of Kenya a cost that was not envisaged in the calculation of maintenance.</li><li>Under the Constitution, the maintenance of children was an equal parental responsibility. The fact that the respondent was to pay maintenance under the <i>talak</i> document, was subject to change if circumstances dictated. The change of circumstances included children insisting on studying abroad instead of in Kenya where the father was comfortable paying college fees. The appellant could not sit and watch her former husband perform every duty. The direction that the appellant had to meet some support obligations was not unlawful but constitutional.</li><li>The appellant being a healthy person who was physically fit had to prove that she was doing her best to support her children when the father was overwhelmed. There was every justification for the trial court to vary the interlocutory maintenance order in her final judgment and that the variation did not amount to sitting as an appellate court in its own judgment. Parents needed to enjoy good health during their old age and not to live miserable lives on account of their children’s unlimited demands. One could not be a permanent child simply because there was a parent to provide forever. Children had to know that extension of parental responsibility was not absolute but a privilege accorded and sanctioned through the court and could be withdrawn any time by the court even <i>suo motto</i>.</li><li>In every decision made by the court or any other person, the best interests of the child had to be taken into consideration. Parental care and protection were equally shared responsibilities of both parents. Shared responsibility presupposed ability. Section 94(1) of the Children Act stipulated the considerations by which the court would be guided when making an order for financial provision for the maintenance of a child.</li><li>It was incumbent upon the appellant to prove or demonstrate to the court that in arriving at its decision, the court exhibited bias or violated her rights. Although the appellant had alleged discrimination on account of her sex, her role as a mother, financial status, and medical and educational status, no evidence was led to support such an inference. Section 108 of the Evidence Act provided that the burden of proof in a suit or procedure lay on that person who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side. Section 109 of the Evidence Act further provided that the burden of proof as to any particular fact lay on the person who wished the court to believe in its existence unless it was provided by any law that the proof of that fact should lay on any particular person.</li><li>The appellant was duty-bound to prove the specific constitutional violations. It was not enough to state that the appellant’s constitutional rights were violated through discrimination. There was no violation of any constitutional right/s of the appellant nor discrimination by being told to wake up from the dependency bed to a more robust and supportive lifestyle. The burden to prove denial of her constitutional right purely lay in the hands of the appellant.</li><li>An appellate court should be slow in interfering with the exercise of the discretion of a trial court. An appellate court could only tinker with a decision if it was satisfied that the discretion of that court was not exercised judiciously.</li></ol></td></tr>                                                    <tr><th>Extract:</th><td><p><b>Cases</b></p><p><b><i>East Africa;</i></b></p><ol><li><i>Abok James Odera t/a AJ Odera &amp; Associates v John Patrick Machira t/a Machira &amp; Co Advocates</i> [2013] eKLR — Explained</li><li><i>Anarita karimi Njeru v Republic (No.1)</i> (1979) 1 KLR 154 — Applied</li><li><i>CIN v JNN</i> [2014] eKLR — Mentioned</li><li><i>George Mugo &amp; another v AKM (minor suing through next friend and mother of AMK</i> [2018] eKLR — Explained</li><li><i>Mbogo v Shah &amp; anothe</i>r [1968] EA 93 — Explained</li><li><i>MOA v HAO</i> [2021] eKLR — Explained</li><li><i>Olive Mwihaki Mugenda &amp; another v Okiya Omtata Okoiti &amp; 4 others</i> Civil Appeal 3 &amp; 11 of 2016; [2016] eKLR — Explained</li><li><i>Peninah Nadako Kiliswa v Independent Electoral &amp; Boundaries Commission (IEBC) &amp; 2 others </i>Petition No. 28 of 2013; [2015] eKLR — Explained</li></ol><p><b>Statutes</b></p><p><b><i>East Africa;</i></b></p><ol><li>Children Act &nbsp;(cap 141) sections 2, 4(2)(3)(4); 23(1); 24 (i); 28(1)(2); 91(b); 98; 99 — (Interpreted)</li><li>Constitution of Kenya, 2010 articles 27, 53(1)(e)(2); 159 (2)(a) — Interpreted</li></ol><p><b>International Instruments &amp; Conventions</b></p><h4>African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, 1990 articles 2 &amp; 3</h4><h4>Advocates</h4><p>None mentioned</p></td></tr>

      <span class="akn-h4">Brief facts</span>
      <span class="akn-p">The appellant instituted a suit against her husband, the respondent, at the trial court seeking among other orders; an extension of parental responsibility against the respondent in respect of MSS aged 20 years; a custody order requiring that legal custody, care and control of the issues of their marriage namely; MSS, NSS and ISS be awarded to the appellant; a maintenance order requiring the respondent to make periodic financial payment as the court deemed fit to the appellant in respect of the maintenance of the issues. During the pendency of the main suit, several applications were filed culminating in a number of rulings giving rise to various interlocutory orders.</span><span class="akn-p">The trial court held that parental responsibility of NSS remained extended as per the orders of March 19, 2018 and further to the orders, the same orders would  end upon her attaining the age of 23 years unless the respondent extended them; parental responsibility against the respondent with regards to MSS was to stop upon delivery of the judgment; the respondent was to make a monthly contribution of KES 40,000 for the upkeep of ISS and NSS, deductible directly from the respondent’s pension account; and that the amount of KES 120, 000 being received by the appellant from the respondent’s pension account was to be stopped. Dissatisfied with the trial court’s judgment, the appellant filed the instant appeal. </span>

    <div class="akn-div holdings">
      <span class="akn-h4">Held</span>
      <ol class="akn-ol">
<li class="akn-li">Being a first appeal, the court had a duty to analyse and re-examine the evidence adduced in the trial court and reach its own conclusion while always bearing in mind that it neither saw nor heard the witnesses testify and make allowance for that fact.</li>
<li class="akn-li">Parental responsibility was defined under Part III, section 23(1) of the Children Act as all the duties, rights, powers, responsibilities and authority that by law a parent of a child had in relation to the child. Under section 2 of the Children Act, a child was referred to as any human being under the age of 18 years. Parents were under obligation to provide for their children and ensure that their rights under article 53 of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 (Constitution) and the Children Act were provided for.</li>
<li class="akn-li">Article 53(1)(e) of the Constitution provided that, a child had the right to parental care and protection, which included equal responsibility of the mother and father to provide for the child, whether they were married to each other or not. As a general principle but in theory, when a child attained the age of 18 years, he or she was deemed to be independent and capable of doing his or her things and therefore no longer entitled to be provided for by the parents. Nevertheless, that was not the true position in real life as that was the age when such a child needed educational support.</li>
<li class="akn-li">There were exceptions to the general rule to the extent that, parental responsibility in respect of a child who had attained the age of majority could be extended if the court was satisfied that special circumstances existed with regard to the welfare of the child. The special circumstances were provided under section 28(1) of the Children Act. Section 91(b) of the Children Act provided for exceptional circumstances when a person who was not a child could apply to the court for a maintenance order.</li>
<li class="akn-li">The court should not make orders in vain. Any and all interlocutory orders lapsed upon delivery of judgment after the full and final determination of a suit. The first order for the extension of parental responsibilities was an interlocutory order which was subject to change upon making orders in the final judgment. The trial court did not sit like an appellate court overturning its own decision when reviewing the orders in its final judgment. Interlocutory orders were by their very nature not final orders unless adopted as such by consent or arrived at by the court in its judgment.</li>
<li class="akn-li">Since the court had already extended parental responsibility for MSS for purposes of finishing her studies, the trial court acted improperly and indeed in error by stopping further parental responsibility in terms of stopping payment of school fees by the respondent while fully aware that the respondent had partly contributed to non-completion of her studies in good time by withdrawing payment of school fees on account of the child’s indiscipline.</li>
<li class="akn-li">In the circumstances, it was not in the best interests of the child to terminate her studies at the final stage. To that extent, the trial court wrongly exercised its discretion by stopping parental responsibility at the critical stage of a child’s career and future based on poor performance and indiscipline of the child. The benefits of completing her education far outweighed any other factor bearing in mind the money and time already spent <i class="akn-i">vis a vis</i> the outstanding amount and time remaining to complete her education. The good news however was, MSS had finished her studies and if there were any outstanding fees (arrears) or expenses, then, the respondent was under obligation to clear the same.</li>
<li class="akn-li">If MSS had indeed finished college which was the main reason for the extension of parental responsibility in her favour, there would be nothing binding the respondent from further taking full parental responsibility against her unless a fresh application was made with sufficient reasons or grounds.</li>
<li class="akn-li">The discretion to impose conditions attendant to the extension of parental responsibility purely lay with the trial court. In the instant case, the court considered the duration a degree course was likely to take to complete. To that extent, there was no irregularity or abuse of discretion in fixing time as a condition for extension of parental responsibility.</li>
<li class="akn-li">Further extension of parental responsibilities should NSS for whatever reason including sickness fail to complete her education in time would only be done by the respondent. Under section 28(2) of the Children Act, any application for extension of parental responsibility could be made by the parent or relative of a child, any person who had parental responsibility for the child, the Director or the child.</li>
<li class="akn-li">Under section 28(2) of the Children Act, the choice as to who was supposed to apply for an extension of parental responsibility was wide. By limiting those powers to the respondent alone, the trial court applied wrong principles in law by blocking any other person entitled in law not to apply for an extension of parental responsibility. Nevertheless, imposing time frames was meant to instill discipline and hard work in children while in school.</li>
<li class="akn-li">It was not proper to give an open cheque for children to stay in school as long as they wanted yet after the age of 18 years, what a parent did for a child was a privilege that even the court could on its own motion grant or withdraw for good reason.</li>
<li class="akn-li">The respondent was retired and of advanced age. The respondent received a monthly pension of KES. 120,000 from the Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) and Kengen and had two other wives plus other children. All the companies to which the appellant used to be a director and/or partner were no longer operational hence there was no income that was derived from the companies. It was clear from the proceedings that there was a maintenance order made against the respondent to be paying a sum of KES. 120,000 out of his pension. That amount was based on the promise made under <i class="akn-i">talak</i> document in divorce proceedings that the respondent was to maintain the children.</li>
<li class="akn-li">Upon the children attaining the age of majority and subsequent extension of parental responsibility, and upon them proceeding abroad for further studies, the cost of their maintenance shifted from home to their place of stay that was in college. It, therefore, meant that the cost of maintaining them was no longer required or applicable at home but in college which the respondent was incurring through payment of school fees and the attendant maintenance expenses.</li>
<li class="akn-li">Pursuant to section 99 of the Children Act, a court had powers to impose conditions and to vary orders as it found appropriate. There was no parental responsibility agreement between the appellant and the respondent, and the <i class="akn-i">talak</i> document being relied on by the appellant was based on the respondent’s capability to provide for his children, which capability had substantially reduced unlike at the time he was giving the appellant <i class="akn-i">talak</i>. That was because he was retired and did not engage in any kind of gainful employment because of his advanced age.</li>
<li class="akn-li">The respondent was under a duty to maintain children. In the absence of children, the appellant would not be entitled to anything. Therefore, the demand for a full amount of maintenance as it used to be when she was staying with the children full time was not tenable. Besides, the <i class="akn-i">talak</i> document had no specific monthly maintenance expenses.</li>
<li class="akn-li">The <i class="akn-i">talak</i> document was dependent on the unmeasured and unspecified financial ability of the respondent. That did not stop the respondent from making his contribution to her children. The respondent was a human being with limited financial resources. He could not stretch beyond the limit. If he had been straining when paying school fees for three children and meeting other obligations, he could not continue doing so even when two of the children were out of Kenya a cost that was not envisaged in the calculation of maintenance.</li>
<li class="akn-li">Under the Constitution, the maintenance of children was an equal parental responsibility. The fact that the respondent was to pay maintenance under the <i class="akn-i">talak</i> document, was subject to change if circumstances dictated. The change of circumstances included children insisting on studying abroad instead of in Kenya where the father was comfortable paying college fees. The appellant could not sit and watch her former husband perform every duty. The direction that the appellant had to meet some support obligations was not unlawful but constitutional.</li>
<li class="akn-li">The appellant being a healthy person who was physically fit had to prove that she was doing her best to support her children when the father was overwhelmed. There was every justification for the trial court to vary the interlocutory maintenance order in her final judgment and that the variation did not amount to sitting as an appellate court in its own judgment. Parents needed to enjoy good health during their old age and not to live miserable lives on account of their children’s unlimited demands. One could not be a permanent child simply because there was a parent to provide forever. Children had to know that extension of parental responsibility was not absolute but a privilege accorded and sanctioned through the court and could be withdrawn any time by the court even <i class="akn-i">suo motto</i>.</li>
<li class="akn-li">In every decision made by the court or any other person, the best interests of the child had to be taken into consideration. Parental care and protection were equally shared responsibilities of both parents. Shared responsibility presupposed ability. Section 94(1) of the Children Act stipulated the considerations by which the court would be guided when making an order for financial provision for the maintenance of a child.</li>
<li class="akn-li">It was incumbent upon the appellant to prove or demonstrate to the court that in arriving at its decision, the court exhibited bias or violated her rights. Although the appellant had alleged discrimination on account of her sex, her role as a mother, financial status, and medical and educational status, no evidence was led to support such an inference. Section 108 of the Evidence Act provided that the burden of proof in a suit or procedure lay on that person who would fail if no evidence at all were given on either side. Section 109 of the Evidence Act further provided that the burden of proof as to any particular fact lay on the person who wished the court to believe in its existence unless it was provided by any law that the proof of that fact should lay on any particular person.</li>
<li class="akn-li">The appellant was duty-bound to prove the specific constitutional violations. It was not enough to state that the appellant’s constitutional rights were violated through discrimination. There was no violation of any constitutional right/s of the appellant nor discrimination by being told to wake up from the dependency bed to a more robust and supportive lifestyle. The burden to prove denial of her constitutional right purely lay in the hands of the appellant.</li>
<li class="akn-li">An appellate court should be slow in interfering with the exercise of the discretion of a trial court. An appellate court could only tinker with a decision if it was satisfied that the discretion of that court was not exercised judiciously.</li>

Counsel submitted that the issue of parental responsibility for MSS had already been canvassed during the hearing of an application dated 2<sup class="akn-sup">nd</sup> April, 2015 and the court held that parental responsibility could be extended beyond the 18<sup class="akn-sup">th</sup> birthday. As regards payment of school fees, it was counsel’s contention that the defendant should continue catering for the same. Learned counsel asserted that the trial magistrate unilaterally stopped payment of school fees for MSS a child in university without jurisdiction hence sitting as an appellate court over its own decision.</span></span>

That the trial court erred in fixing a monthly maintenance amount of kshs 40,000/= without considering the lifestyle of the children and their needs a fact that was not disputed in the defendant’s defence.</span></span>

Counsel relied on the finding in the case of <i class="akn-i">SB v AAL</i> [2010] eKLR, to buttress the point that the duties of a mother do not cease and cannot be compared to a monthly maintenance cheque as doing so would amount to discrimination against the role of a mother and a woman. Further reference was made in respect to the case of <span class="akn-ref" data-href="">GO &amp; 2 others (suing through their mother and next friend) EMM v MOO(2016)eKLR</span> where the court held that parental responsibility does not mean equal responsibility and similar contribution as the income of each parent and other non-monetary contribution should be borne in mind.</span></span>

Counsel submitted that the court failed to uphold the principles enshrined under article 2 &amp; 3 of the <span class="akn-ref" data-href="placeholder-trIXV">African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the child</span> which prohibits all forms of discrimination against children.</span></span>

Further, it was urged that a judgment by the trial court is an opportunity by the court to pronounce itself in finality in respect to issues raised during the trial as opposed to a ruling.

Further, on the issue of the talak document, counsel argued that the said document could not be termed as a parental care agreement. Counsel opined that the amount demanded by the appellant was ridiculous and that the court did clearly note that the appellant was confusing her needs as a divorced wife and those of her children. Further, that the appellant having been awarded movable and immovable properties in HC (OS) No 3 of 2015, she cannot purport not to have any source of income.</span></span>

Since the court had already extended parental responsibility for Mariam for purposes of finishing her studies, the learned magistrate acted improperly and indeed in error by stopping further parental responsibility in terms of stopping payment of school fees by the respondent while fully aware that the respondent had partly contributed to non-completion of her studies in good time by withdrawing payment of school fees on account of the child’s indiscipline.</span></span>

To that extent, the trial court did wrongly exercise its discretion by stopping parental responsibility at the critical stage of a child’s career and future based on poor performance and indiscipline of the child. The benefits of completing her education far outweighs any other factor bearing in mind the money and time already spent vis a vis the outstanding amount and time remaining to complete her education. The good news however is, M has finished her studies and if there is any outstanding fees (arrears) or expenses, then, the respondent is under obligation to clear the same.</span></span>

It is trite that the discretion to impose conditions attendant to extension of parental responsibility purely lies with the trial court.
